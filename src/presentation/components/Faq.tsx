    question: "What is Chronos?",
    answer:
      "Chronos is a decision intelligence platform. You set an objective and context; it generates multiple futures, compares trade-offs, and recommends a path with transparent reasons — then remembers goals, runs, and outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Chronos different from LLM chatbots?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Most models return a single answer.</p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Chronos runs branch → simulate → collapse: multiple strategies, scored
          trade-offs, a ranked recommendation with “Recommended because” reasons,
          and a Decision Report you can share and reopen later.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What does branch → simulate → collapse mean?",
    answer:
      "Branch generates alternative futures. Simulate scores each against your goal and constraints. Collapse ranks them into a recommendation and Decision Report — you still choose which path to save.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I trust a recommendation?",
    answer:
      "Every recommendation explains why in plain language (e.g. lowest execution risk, fits your objective, fewer dependencies, highest expected success), plus alternatives, confidence, risks, and next actions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Chronos for?",
    answer:
      "Founders, developers, product managers, researchers, and teams making complex decisions where one-shot answers are not enough.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does a simulation work?",
    answer:
      "Define a goal, add knowledge/context, set constraints, then generate futures. Compare paths, read the Decision Report, choose a path, and optionally log whether you followed it and how it turned out.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a workspace?",
    answer:
      "A private HQ for goals, knowledge, simulations, decision history, and outcomes. You can create multiple workspaces and switch without losing history.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Knowledge Library?",
    answer:
      "Documents, notes, and web resources that ground simulations. Context used in a run is listed on the Decision Report.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I leave and come back later?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Previous goals, simulations, saved decisions, knowledge, and outcome notes persist. Memory is one of Chronos’ core advantages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Chronos available today?",
    answer:
      "Chronos is in public beta. The core idea → decision loop works; see Docs → Beta limitations for current edges.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is CLAB?",
    answer:
      "CLAB is the planned native asset of the Chronos ecosystem. It is intended to support platform access, incentives, and coordination as the ecosystem grows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need CLAB to use Chronos?",
    answer:
      "No. The core Chronos platform is designed to be usable without requiring CLAB. The asset is planned for ecosystem-level capabilities rather than basic product access.",
  },
