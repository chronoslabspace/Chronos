// Chronos Agents — Domain-specific decision makers that use Chronos Core.
//
// Each agent brings:
//   - a narrative (what it does, what decisions it faces)
//   - a world model (what reality looks like from its perspective)
//   - candidate actions (what it's considering doing next)
//   - a scoring intuition (what "good" means in its domain)
//
// Chronos doesn't care about the domain. It runs the same engine:
//   fork → evaluate → collapse → commit
// The agent just brings its own reality.
